# predictable-customers
Proof of concept to demonstrate using statistical models to identify possible customers for auto insurance.

The code in this repository was created for a mock- financial services client. The end result was a client-ready notebook (Client Report.ipnyb) that is intended to walk a non-technical business partner through the entire modeling process - this notebook can also serve as a good reference point for beginner analysts looking to get started with data science. The remaining notebooks (LogisticRegression.ipynb & RandomForestClient.ipnyb) provide a look into how the sausage was made - these contain a more detailed code samples created as a collaboration between the two data analysts on the project team. 

NOTE: all AWS resources used to store the underlying data have been decomissioned, so these notebooks will not run in Python (use for reference only).
